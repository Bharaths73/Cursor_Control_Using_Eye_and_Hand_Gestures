# Cursor Pointer Control Using Eye and Hand Gestures

This project demonstrates an innovative approach to controlling a computer cursor using real-time eye and hand gestures. By leveraging machine learning and computer vision techniques, the system interprets user gestures and translates them into precise cursor movements. This provides a hands-free and touchless interaction method, useful for accessibility applications or innovative user interfaces.


## Features

**Real-time Gesture Recognition:**
Uses MediaPipe to detect eye and hand gestures.
Supports controlling cursor movement based on hand position and eye gaze direction.

**Mode Switching:**
Switch between eye and hand gesture control modes dynamically.
A simple Tkinter GUI enables easy switching between modes.

**Accuracy and Responsiveness:**
Accurate gesture recognition with low latency for smooth cursor movements.





## Tech Stack

**Python**
